# Octopus Development Rules

## Do It Right The First Time (no MVPs, no future-polish)

**If we choose to do something, we do it perfectly — right now, in
this session.** No "minimal fix", no "MVP for now", no "we'll polish
this later". No deferral of cleanup to a "follow-up" item.

This rule is non-negotiable. Specifically that means:

- Never ship a half-done implementation and document the rest as
  "future work". If the full thing isn't worth doing right now, then
  don't start it at all.
- Never park the cleaner version in a "deferred work" note
  *instead* of doing it. Genuine deferrals (work that needs a real
  second use case, an external dep, or a user decision) belong in
  the relevant plan doc's §10 "What this defers"; nothing else is a
  legitimate place to stash "felt too long".
- Never add a comment like `# TODO: handle X properly later` or `#
  HACK: works for now`. If `X` matters, handle it in this change.
  If it doesn't matter, delete the comment.
- When the user asks "fix this", interpret it as "fix it the way a
  careful engineer with infinite time would" — not "ship the
  smallest patch that no longer crashes".
- "MVP" is not a status the user has to accept. There is no future
  in which a later session will go back and polish; in the AI era
  we have the bandwidth to do it right *now*, here, in one go.

This rule exists because past sessions repeatedly took the shortcut
and then had to be told to go back and do the real thing. Skip the
shortcut. Do the real thing the first time.

## After Every Code Change

You MUST verify your changes before considering them done:

1. **Backend unit tests**: `.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v` (1160 tests; all of them
   run on a dev box with the CLIs installed and signed in — a skip means a
   lapsed login, not a passing suite. The real-CLI tests gate on their binary —
   `test_backend_claude_code_real.py` + `test_schedule_ai_real.py` +
   `test_showme_ai_real.py` + the 2-hop / question-loop / 3-hop cases in
   `test_delegations_real.py` need `claude`; `test_backend_codex_real.py` +
   `test_codex_login_real.py` need `codex`; `test_agent_memory_real.py` +
   the claude→codex case in `test_delegations_real.py` need **both** —
   run with the nvm bin prepended, see Conventions. The DSH ones are separate:
   `test_dsh_profile_conformance.py` needs only `dsh` on PATH (it composes the
   profile and never runs a turn), while `test_backend_dsh_real.py` needs `dsh`
   **and** `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — DSH authenticates with a key rather than a login
   flow, so without one a turn cannot run)
2. **Frontend unit tests**: `cd web && bun run test` (200 tests)
3. **TypeScript check**: `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit`
4. **E2E tests**: `cd web && bun run test:e2e` (78 tests, no skips, ~4 min, Playwright
   auto-starts servers). Split into two buckets for dev iteration —
   `bun run test:e2e:fast` (41 pure-UI tests, ~30 s — login / sessions /
   dialogs / sidebar / virtualized chat / attachments / etc.) and
   `bun run test:e2e:llm` (37 real-LLM tests, ~3 min — chat, /schedule,
   /showme, /archive, mcp__bg__run, AskUserQuestion, agent-collaboration,
   notifier, codex sign-in, DSH turn, handoff/pull). Anything that drives a real
   `claude` / `codex` / `dsh` turn carries `@llm` in its describe title; the
   `:fast` script uses `--grep-invert @llm`. `codex.spec.ts` needs a
   signed-in `codex` (`codex login --device-auth`); a lapsed login fails
   it rather than hiding it. `dsh.spec.ts`'s turn test needs a
   `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the runner's environment (it stores it as a
   credential itself) and the `dsh` binary; the mocked half of that spec
   needs neither. Telegram bridge tests have their own config and run via
   `test:e2e:bridge`.

**Zero test failures are acceptable.** All tests must pass before committing. If a test fails, investigate and fix it — do not ignore, skip, or dismiss any failure as "flaky" or "pre-existing".

## Test Coverage

| Suite | Tool | Count | What it covers |
|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| Backend unit | pytest | 1160 | Config, models, session manager, REST API (auth, CRUD, 404s, reset), database persistence (incl. credential storage split + refresh-error codes), JSONL parser/writer, CLI (handoff, pull), import API, schedules CRUD + scheduler runner (interval **and cron** triggers) + schedule-recurrence migration + **overlap guard and provenance** (`scheduled-runs.md`: a fire is skipped while the previous one is still running — recorded in `last_run_session_id` *before* the turn starts, so an in-flight fire is visible to the next tick — while a gone or idle session never wedges the schedule; in origin-session mode only a *second* queued fire is refused, since queuing behind the user is the design; and the turn arrives marked `[scheduled:<name> — <recurrence>]` so the agent knows nobody is waiting to answer questions), **natural-language `/schedule` parsing** (`schedule_ai`: rigid fast-path, JSON extraction, cron/interval validation, `from_text` route — harness-agnostic, runs on the agent's own harness claude-code **or** codex, with fake + real-CLI AI), bridge base/manager/telegram (incl. **per-chat verbosity** — quiet by default, hiding tool/result/status events, `/quiet`+`/verbose` toggle persisted through `/agent` rebinds — and **session-switch via inline buttons**: `/sessions` renders a tappable picker, shared `switch_session` for the `switch:<id>` callback + `/switch` command), tunnel config, OAuth provider registry, agents (manager + routes), **inline steering** (`_try_steer` accepting a message into the turn already running — window open only between stream start and `result`, bounded at 8, attachments and non-stdin backends refused so they queue instead; the per-turn writer task that wakes on the queue rather than on events, holds the lock across the write, and hands anything undelivered back to the normal queue), **held CLI processes** (`StdinMode` enum replacing the close-stdin boolean, prompt delivered as a stdin JSON frame with a unique uuid per frame — the CLI dedupes on it, so a repeat silently drops the command; `spawn_signature` refusing reuse when anything baked in at spawn moved; the idle reaper, the synchronous LRU cap and the bounded shutdown sweep), **real-CLI gates** (a probe timeout retries once then fails loudly — a timeout is not a lapsed login, and must never become a silent skip), **streamed assistant text** (`--include-partial-messages` → `ClaudeEventParser._stream_delta` → broadcast-only `text_delta` events, coalesced into one `assistant_delta` frame per 50ms and never persisted; the Telegram bridge ignores them so a reply can't be sent twice), **harness layer** (`harness`: one `Harness` + one `HarnessRun` subprocess engine driven by a per-backend `RuntimeProfile` value — no per-framework subclasses; shared MCP/system-prompt assembly, registry + derived predicates, `run_oneshot` for both backends, claude + codex argv/parser snapshots, real-CLI for both when on PATH), **Codex in-app login** (`codex_login` device-auth orchestrator with a fake CLI: scrape URL+code, success/fail/cancel, per-credential `CODEX_HOME` resolution via `resolve_credential_by_id(style="home_dir")`, `/credentials/codex/*` routes; real-CLI start when `codex` on PATH), **connectors** (DB split-secret + agent-join, manager incl. token-refresh lifecycle + in-app OAuth-client config + custom-connector CRUD, OAuth providers, REST routes incl. OAuth flow, the github/gmail/generic MCP servers), **agent memory** (`agent_memory`: per-agent native-memory path derivation + idempotent provisioning; harness wiring giving Claude a `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_PATH_OVERRIDE` (never `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — resume-transcript regression guard) and Codex a memory-dir blurb in `developer_instructions` *without* enabling `features.memories`; agent-manager dir provision/cleanup; gated real-CLI read-back for both harnesses **plus a Claude `--resume`-survives-memory-override** check), **agent-to-agent collaboration** (`delegations` + `ask_agent` MCP server: parent_session_id schema + 'delegation' origin, DelegationManager registry / broadcast-subscriber / cycle+depth-3 guards, nested-chain deferral in **both** orderings (a child that asked someone else waits for its relay turn whether or not the sub-delegation is still running when its turn ends) while a one-hop child still finalises on its first result, name-resolution case-insensitive + ambiguity/self-rejection, REST routes POST/GET/follow-up/cancel + caller-aware ask question routing, answer_agent_question helper + route, MCP-tool unit tests for bimodal ask/cancel/list/answer surface, and real-CLI 2-hop / question-loop / 3-hop chain plus claude→codex harness-agnostic gate), **token rotation** (`token_rotation`: the token is also the key every stored secret is encrypted with, so rotating re-keys `credential_secrets` / `connector_installation_secrets` / `connector_oauth_clients`, rewrites the env files that define it, swaps the live setting and drops the processes holding the old one — in an order where any failure leaves nothing changed; every refusal, and the all-or-nothing guarantee when one row won't decrypt; an explicit `OCTOPUS_ENV_FILE` is the whole candidate list, never a first guess), **native sub-agents** (`SubagentUpdate`: **work that outlives its turn** — Claude Code runs some sub-agents asynchronously, so the completion and the follow-up turn the CLI wakes to report it arrive after the turn's `result`; a held run's idle handler routes them into the session (persisted + broadcast) instead of dropping them, while token deltas are the one thing it drops — out of turn they repaint a stale partial over an answer already on screen, and releasing a process closes out the runs that lived inside it;  Claude Code's four `system/task_*` shapes — including the anonymous `task_updated`, which carries only a task id — and Codex's `collab_tool_call` items normalized onto one event; a Codex sub-agent tracked across the separate `spawn_agent` and `wait` calls that describe it; both parsers' identity maps bounded; progress broadcast but never persisted, merged onto the session's live map and carried on the snapshot so a reload repaints the card; `--agents` JSON rendering, dropping nameless drafts and omitting empty optionals; a real `Task` run and a custom sub-agent answering by the name its Octopus agent gave it), **application↔agent conversations** (`app_agent`: a conversation is a session with `origin='app'` + the new `sessions.app_id`, so it resumes, persists and is readable in the chat view; the per-app scoped token — derived, never stored, useless against another app, and the reason a backend script can reach the agent API without ever holding the master token; the first-turn preamble that says reply-as-prose / don't-edit-the-app's-code / work-in-the-data-dir; every cap (message, context, conversations, turns in flight) as its own status code; a turn that is still unwinding is waited out rather than refused, but one busy with someone else's turn is refused; the SSE vocabulary `conversation → delta/message/tool/question → done|error`; deleting an application taking its threads), **application backends** (`app_backends`: an executable `start.sh` IS the declaration — no manifest; scripts get a minimal environment, never the server's, so the Octopus token and credentials can't leak into app code; lazy start, TCP-accept readiness, idle reap, LRU cap, crash backoff, process-group teardown; a daemonizing script is reported as such rather than timing out; delete stops the backend and removes the sibling data/runtime dirs; `/apps/{id}/api/*` proxies with auth stripped before it reaches the app), **home-screen icons** (the build prompt states the four rules that fail silently otherwise — PNG not SVG, opaque, 180x180, full-bleed with no corners of its own — plus the relative-href trap, since an app lives under `/apps/<id>/` and an absolute href resolves against Octopus), **application icons** (discovery from the app's own files — the root convention, and the `<link rel="icon">` the page declares, including a subdirectory path or an inline `data:` URI; traversal, remote and oversize candidates refused; server-owned `icon_src` that a rebuild refreshes and a deleted file clears, never touching the user's emoji; startup backfill so an app that already ships a logo needs no rebuild), **applications** (`applications`: slug allocation + de-dup, entrypoint validation, traversal/symlink guards, create wires a build session + fires the brief, the broadcast subscriber deriving building/ready/failed from the entrypoint on disk, follow-up builds reusing (or re-opening) the session, rename/entrypoint updates, delete guarded to the managed root, archive/restore incl. the live-only name index, REST routes, and the `/apps/{id}/…` static route with bearer/query/cookie auth), **DSH** (`dsh_home`: one `DSH_HOME` per agent + the generated per-spawn patch — persona, the pinned posture and the memory dir, each row's fields restated because a DSH patch replaces a whole config; the `AGENTS.md` → `MEMORY.md` memory view; the session-store purge on delete; symlink-or-copy fallbacks; the shared profile workspace. `harness/dsh`: argv + env rendering, the one-shot, the declared degradations, and the error-pattern tables — **the auth table is verified by a real rejected key**, because a guessed one would silently make re-auth a no-op. `harness/dsh_acp`: the ACP client against a scripted fake server — required `mcpServers`, re-sent on resume, the opaque `JSON.stringify([provider, model])` value, `messageId` chunk coalescing, answering `session/request_permission`, `session/cancel`, error frames, and a dead process failing a pending request. Plus a **profile-conformance test** that runs `dsh --dump-config --profile acp --patch <ours>` and asserts the composed tree carries what we meant, *and* that the shipped rows still have exactly the fields the patch restates — so a DSH upgrade fails loudly instead of silently dropping a persona or a posture) |
| Frontend unit | vitest | 200 | Zustand store (token, sessions, messages, status, agents, connectors), useWebSocket, BgTaskChip, FileViewerDialog, SlashCommandMenu, **delegation cards** (AgentDelegationEventCard parser + reply/question/error variants with options-as-text + open-child resolving from both `sessions` and `archivedSessions`; AgentDelegationRequestCard with running/completed states + delegation_id-from-tool_result matching + open-child + cancel POST), **fork** (ForkDialog picker/confirm, deferredFork store helper), **application backends** (BackendPanel: state, port and uptime, with the install/start log one click away — a dead backend with no output is the failure the feature exists to avoid), **application icons** (AppIcon: emoji beats the app's own icon beats the fallback; a file goes through `/apps/{id}/…` versioned by last_built_at with the app cookie primed, an inline `data:` URI is used verbatim, a failed load falls back rather than leaving a torn image), **application chrome** (the page carries no composer bar — the Iterate popover holds the change request and the build-session link, closes on Escape without sending and on a successful send; the app's own agent conversations list from the header and open in the chat view, and never appear in the sidebar rail), **applications** (SidebarApplications seed/select/status-dots/delete; ApplicationView ready/building/failed branches, iframe sandbox + app cookie, reload + auto-swap on rebuild, change-request composer), **steering** (the `steered` marker distinguishing a message sent into the running turn from a queued one), **streaming** (MessageBubble's plain mode — partial text renders verbatim instead of re-parsing markdown on every flush; the `streamingText` buffer: deltas accumulate per session, the completed block drops it, a tool_use mid-stream doesn't, and a snapshot reload clears it), **console redesign** (SidebarManage summaries + navigation, AgentFormPage and ApplicationFormPage incl. their Archived tabs and restore, SidebarAgents fold state — every agent folded on load, click to open, the new-session "+" opening only its own rail), **sidebar fold** (SidebarEdgeToggle's direction / label / persistence, and an agent clicked on the icon rail unfolding the sidebar with it), **schedule run history** (the "last run" row opens the session that fire ran in, and stays inert for rows that predate the link), **the mobile drawer** (every navigation action closes it — the close lives in the store so no call site, present or future, can forget — and it is never persisted), **rotating the token from Settings** (sent with the token being replaced, reports how many secrets were re-keyed and which file was written, surfaces the server's refusal, and the socket paths: a rotation hands this tab the new token, a revoking one signs it out), **sub-agent cards** (what a run says while it works; clicking it opens the answer, the step trail and the brief; a failure that says so; the trail built from progress without repeating a step, and replaced wholesale when a snapshot brings the server's; and the merge that keeps a partial update from blanking what it doesn't restate), **the app's height** (`useViewportHeight`: the visual viewport is followed only while a field is focused, because iOS leaves a stale shrunken height behind once the keyboard animates away — an app sized from that strands its composer in a band of dead page; blur re-measures over the next 650ms), ResearchCard, **the engine picker's labels and default** (`lib/harness`: a kind's display name, an unknown kind shown raw rather than hidden, and the default engine read from the server's first entry so "which engine is the default" lives in one place) |
| E2E | Playwright | 78 | Login, session CRUD, real Claude responses (incl. AskUserQuestion + resume), Enter to send, input/state while running, WebSocket reconnect, mobile layout (the drawer closing itself when a session is picked, the closed drawer entirely off-screen, no sideways scroll, no field small enough to make iOS zoom, and a composer that stays on the bottom edge even when the visual viewport lies about its height), CLI handoff/pull + roundtrip + API cleanup, Telegram bridge (fake API server — quiet-mode octo replies, `/sessions` switch buttons, `/quiet`+`/verbose` toggles), schedules (`/schedule` command → all-agents overview dialog, toggle/delete), archived-sessions account-menu manage page (view read-only + unarchive), message queue + Esc interrupt, virtualized chat scrolling, OAuth dialog flow (Claude Code + **Codex device-code sign-in** via the Harness chooser), credential override, agents rail/settings, **connectors** (catalog + availability gating, in-app Set-up flips a built-in to connectable, add/remove a custom connector, per-agent toggles), `/research` deep-research, `/rewind` fork + deferred-fork while running, **streamed text** (deltas arrive before the completed block and the partial buffer is gone afterwards), **inline steering** (a message typed mid-turn reaches the running agent and redirects it — asserted on the tool calls it actually made, since the prompt itself names the steps), **native sub-agents** (a real `Task` narrates itself in a card — named, progressing, opening to its step trail and brief, then completed with its answer — while nothing extra lands in the transcript), **applications** (create pane + validation; and the real loop — an agent builds an app, it renders in the pane's iframe, the running app asks a real agent about context it supplies and gets prose back while that conversation stays out of the sidebar, a change request from the Iterate popover lands in the same build session, `/apps/{id}/` auth, delete), **foldable sidebar** (the handle is invisible and unclickable until its edge is hovered, the collapsed rail keeps its icons and still navigates, the choice survives a reload), **DSH** (`dsh.spec.ts`: the credential dialog saves a pasted API key as a `dsh`/`api_key` credential — mocked, deterministic — and a real `@llm` test creates a DSH session through the UI, picks its credential, and gets a real answer plus a result badge; that half needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and the `dsh` binary) |

## Project Structure

- `server/` — Python backend (FastAPI)
- `server/cli.py` — CLI entry point (`serve`, `handoff`, `pull`)
- `server/database.py` — SQLite persistence layer
- `server/scheduler.py` — APScheduler-based recurring task runner
- `server/jsonl_parser.py` — Claude Code JSONL session parser
- `server/jsonl_writer.py` — JSONL writer for session export
- `server/routers/` — REST + WebSocket routers (`sessions`, `schedules`, `agents`, `applications`, `credentials`, `connectors`, `delegations`, `research`, `ws`)
- `server/fork_helpers.py` — Pure helpers for session tree-rewind (`/rewind`): git-anchor capture at turn-start, side-effect classification over parent rows, safe-revert preflight + git-stash execution. Backend-agnostic and side-effect-contained.
- `server/research/` — Native deep research orchestration (`docs/plans/native-deep-research.md`): `ResearchManager` (async job lifecycle, phase pipeline, concurrency cap, cancel + reap), `orchestrator` (scope → search → dedup → verify → synthesize phases), `leaf` (throwaway `HarnessRun` sub-turns for web-search leaves and `run_oneshot` for reasoning leaves), `schemas` (JSON schemas for scope/findings/synthesis). Agent-invoked via `mcp__research__deep_research`; user-invoked via `/research <question>`. Result injected as a follow-up turn; a `ResearchCard` tracks progress in the UI.
- `server/mcp_servers/research.py` — Stdio MCP server exposing `mcp__research__deep_research(question)` to agents; thin HTTP shim to `/api/sessions/{sid}/research`. Returns `research_id` immediately so the model's turn ends cleanly.
- `server/bridges/` — Messaging-platform integrations (`telegram`, base + manager). A chat binds to an agent with a sticky session and a per-chat `verbose` flag (quiet by default → only the agent's natural-language replies, errors and approval prompts reach the chat; `QUIET_SUPPRESSED_EVENTS` hides tool calls/results/cost/status; `/quiet`+`/verbose` toggle it, persisted in `bridge_mappings.verbose`). `/sessions` renders a tappable inline-button picker (`send_session_list`) whose `switch:<id>` callback shares `BridgeManager.switch_session` with the `/switch` command
- `docs/plans/token-rotation.md` — `OCTOPUS_AUTH_TOKEN` is both the
  credential clients send and the key `crypto.py` derives to encrypt every
  stored secret, so changing it is one server-side operation (`POST
  /api/auth/rotate`): re-key the secrets, rewrite the env files, swap the live
  setting, drop the processes carrying the old one, and hand the new token to
  the clients already holding the old one. No restart, nothing to edit by hand.
- `docs/plans/scheduled-runs.md` — What a scheduled fire is: the overlap
  guard that stops a slow schedule stacking runs, the `[scheduled:…]` marker
  that tells an agent nobody is waiting to answer questions, and
  `last_run_session_id` linking "last run" to the session it happened in.
- `docs/plans/native-subagents.md` — Native sub-agents, surfaced: Claude
  Code's `Task`/`Agent` runs and Codex's `spawn_agent`/`wait` collaboration
  calls normalized onto one `SubagentUpdate`, shown as a live card keyed on
  the spawning tool call's id (never its name — the CLIs rename it), and
  `agents.subagents` → `--agents` so an Octopus agent brings its own helpers.
- `server/app_agent.py` — The conversations a *running* application holds with an agent (`docs/plans/app-agent-access.md`): `/apps/{id}/agent/{agents,conversations,ask,chat}`, mounted under the app's own path so its page reaches them at `agent/…` relative to itself and its backend reaches them with the scoped `OCTOPUS_APP_TOKEN`. A conversation is a real session (`origin='app'`, `sessions.app_id`), so it resumes across turns and can be read in the chat view; the manager registers a turn on the broadcast bus *before* starting it and converts session events into the vocabulary an app consumes (`delta`, `message`, `tool`, `question`, `done`, `error`), streamed as SSE by `chat` or awaited whole by `ask`.
- `server/app_backends.py` — Supervised backend processes for Applications (`docs/plans/application-backends.md`): an app declares a backend with an executable `start.sh` at its root (optionally `install.sh`), Octopus allocates a port, runs them with a minimal environment, waits for the port to accept, proxies `/apps/{id}/api/*` to it, and stops it when idle. Three directories with three owners: `<slug>/` code (rewritten by a rebuild), `<slug>.data/` the app's own state (never touched), `<slug>.runtime/` installed dependencies (deletable to force a clean reinstall).
- `server/applications.py` — Applications (`docs/plans/applications.md`): agent-built static web apps. Owns the app directory under `~/.octopus/applications`, the *build session* (a normal session with `origin='application'` whose working dir is the app dir), and a `building|ready|failed` status **derived** from whether the entrypoint exists when a build turn ends — the manager subscribes to the SessionManager broadcast bus (the DelegationManager pattern), so a change typed straight into the build session updates the badge too. `POST /{id}/build` runs another turn in that same session. Archiving
(`POST /{id}/archive` / `/unarchive`) keeps the row **and** the files so the
create page's Archived tab can restore an app exactly as it was; the name
index is live-only, so an archived name frees up (same rule as agents, which
gained `POST /api/agents/{id}/unarchive` for the same tab).
- `server/routers/applications.py` — `/api/applications` CRUD **plus** `/apps/{id}/{path}` — the app itself, streamed out of its directory with traversal + symlink guards, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and bearer / `?token=` / `octopus_app_token`-cookie auth (an iframe can't send an Authorization header)
- `server/agent_manager.py` — Agent CRUD (durable assistant definitions that own sessions/schedules)
- `server/agent_memory.py` — Per-agent native memory (`docs/plans/memory.md`): one canonical markdown dir per agent (`<agents_dir>/<id>/memory/`), shared by every harness. Claude points its auto-memory at it via `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_PATH_OVERRIDE`; Codex via an injected `developer_instructions` blurb naming the dir (its native `features.memories` pipeline is unused — it doesn't run in headless `exec`); DSH reads it natively, because `dsh_home` points its `agent-instructions` row at the dir and gives it the `AGENTS.md` name DSH insists on (a symlink to the canonical `MEMORY.md`, or a copy refreshed each spawn where symlinks are unavailable). Memory is decoupled from every harness's config/auth dirs — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` and DSH's own credential store are never touched — so auth and `--resume` transcripts are unaffected. Pure path helpers + idempotent provisioning.
- `server/delegations.py` — Agent-to-agent delegation manager (`docs/plans/agent-collaboration.md`). Subscribes to the SessionManager broadcast bus; on a tracked child session's `assistant_text` / `result` / `error` / `question_request` events, captures + finalises and injects an `[agent-reply:<name> delegation=<id>]` (or `agent-question`, or `agent-error`) follow-up turn into the parent session via the same `start_message` path bg-task delivery uses. Cycle and depth-3 guards walk `parent_session_id`. `answer_pending_question(delegation_id, choice)` drains the child's oldest pending question on the parent's behalf — same Event-signal machinery the human UI uses (first to drain wins). The delegation id IS the child session id; no parallel id space, no new persistence table.
- `server/mcp_servers/ask_agent.py` — Stdio MCP server exposing the four delegation tools to the model: `mcp__ask_agent__ask` / `cancel` / `answer` / `list` (the Python functions are `ask_agent` / `cancel_agent_task` / `answer_agent_question` / `list_agent_tasks`; the `@mcp.tool(name=…)` decorators expose the short forms). `ask(request, name=…, delegation_id=…, files=…)` is bimodal: `name` starts a fresh child session, `delegation_id` continues a prior one in the same child transcript; exactly one id is required. Same `OCTOPUS_API_BASE` / `OCTOPUS_SESSION_ID` env-injection pattern as the bg + ask built-ins; thin HTTP shim to the `/api/sessions/{sid}/delegations` routes, including continuation via `/follow-up`. Added to the default per-agent MCP set; the migration backfills it onto every pre-existing agent row.
- `server/harness/` — Harness layer: the single boundary for all model/runtime interaction (`docs/plans/harness-layer.md`). One `Harness` class + one `HarnessRun` engine, configured by a `RuntimeProfile` *value* per backend kind (`claude-code`, `codex`, `dsh`) — no per-framework subclasses. Holds `assembly` (shared per-turn MCP/system-prompt assembly), `run` (subprocess engine + PATH helpers), `registry` (`get_harness`/`available_backends`, `DEFAULT_BACKEND`), `login` (LoginDriver protocol). A profile supplies its collaborators as data: `new_event_parser` (stdout → events), `new_protocol` (how stdio is *driven* — raw prompt frames, or a request/response protocol; see `StdinMode`), `prepare_spawn`/`prepare_oneshot` (the filesystem-touching half of a spawn, deliberately outside `build_argv` so rendering for inspection stays side-effect free), `cleanup_session` (a harness's own conversation store, dropped with the session). Capabilities are derived from the profile; `run_oneshot` powers backend-agnostic `/schedule` parsing.
- `server/harness/dsh.py` + `server/harness/dsh_acp.py` — The DSH (DeepSeek Harness) profile and its hand-written ACP v1 client (`docs/plans/dsh-harness.md`). Turns run on `dsh --profile acp` over newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdio; one-shots run on `dsh --profile headless`. No ACP SDK dependency — the same "CLIs, not an SDK" decision the claude/codex streams follow — and only the calls this integration needs are implemented. Declared degradations: no token-level streaming (ACP carries committed messages only), no inline steering, sub-agent runs appear as ordinary tool calls, no `--agents` surface, no handoff/pull.
- `server/dsh_home.py` — Per-agent DSH state (`docs/plans/dsh-harness.md` §3.5): one `DSH_HOME` per agent — DSH's sessions, settings, credentials, profiles and its user-global instruction file all travel with it — plus a **generated patch** per spawn (persona + the pinned permission posture + the memory dir DSH reads; a DSH patch replaces the whole config of every row it names, so each field kept is restated deliberately), the shared pre-warmed profile workspace, the `AGENTS.md` → `MEMORY.md` view, and the session-store purge Octopus performs because DSH has no deletion API of its own.
- `server/connectors/` — Connector framework: `base` (ConnectorBase + backend-neutral MCP entry), `oauth` (provider protocol + redirect-URI login manager), `registry`, built-in `github`/`gmail`, and `custom` (user-defined kinds + generic OAuth provider + `resolve_connector`)
- `server/connector_manager.py` — Connector business logic (install upsert, in-app OAuth-client config DB→env resolve, token-refresh lifecycle, custom-connector CRUD)
- `server/mcp_servers/connectors/` — Per-kind stdio MCP servers (`github`, `gmail`, generic `custom`) + shared token/truncation helpers
- `docs/plans/mobile.md` — Octopus on a phone: the drawer that puts itself
  away, 16px fields (iOS zoom), touch hit areas and hover-only affordances,
  headers that shed context rather than function, and the safe-area insets a
  home-screen install needs. Three separate triggers kept apart: `max-width`
  for layout, `hover: none` for input, `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for hardware.
- `web/` — React frontend (Vite + TypeScript). The interface follows
  `docs/plans/console-redesign.md`: `src/styles/tokens.css` is the whole
  palette + type system (blue `#2563b8`, Hanken Grotesk over IBM Plex Mono for
  anything technical), the sidebar is `SidebarAgents` (two-level: agents with
  their sessions) + `SidebarApplications` + `SidebarManage` (Schedules /
  Connectors / Harness summary rows) + `SidebarAccount`, and every manage or
  create surface is a **main-area page** behind the store's `mainView`
  (`SchedulesPage`, `ConnectorsPage`, `HarnessPage`, `AgentFormPage`,
  `ApplicationFormPage`) rather than a dialog. `PageHeader` is the shared
  breadcrumb bar.
- `tests/` — Backend tests (pytest)
- `web/src/**/*.test.ts` — Frontend unit tests (vitest, colocated with source)
- `web/e2e/` — End-to-end tests (Playwright, auto-cleanup after runs)

## Commands

> **Frontend gotcha**: the backend serves `web/dist/` (the built SPA),
> not `web/src/`. Any source change needs `cd web && bun run build`
> before `octopus serve` / `uvicorn server.main:app` users will see it.
> For live HMR, run `cd web && bun dev` and hit the dev server's port
> (5173) instead of the backend.

```bash
# Backend
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v              # run backend tests
.venv/bin/uvicorn server.main:app       # start server (serves web/dist/)

# Frontend
cd web && bun run test                  # run frontend unit tests
cd web && bun run build                 # typecheck + build (refreshes web/dist/)
cd web && bun dev                       # live dev server on :5173

# E2E (Playwright)
cd web && bun run test:e2e              # run e2e tests (headless)
cd web && bun run test:e2e:ui           # run e2e tests with Playwright UI
cd web && npx playwright test --reporter=list  # verbose output
```

## Conventions

- Backend uses Python 3.12+, type hints, async/await
- Frontend uses React 19, TypeScript strict mode, zustand for state
- Use `useSessionStore.getState()` (not hook selectors) inside callbacks/effects that mutate store to avoid re-render loops
- The SDK message parser is patched locally (`.venv/lib/.../message_parser.py`) to handle unknown message types — if you reinstall deps, the patch must be reapplied
- The JS toolchain (`bun`, `node`, `npm`, `npx`) and `codex` live under `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`, **not** on the default PATH. Prepend that bin dir for any frontend/codex command (`export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin:$PATH"`). It's also required for the 4 `test_backend_codex_real.py` tests to resolve `codex` (otherwise they error rather than skip)
