"""Supervised backend processes for Applications (application-backends.md).

An Application declares a backend by shipping an executable `start.sh` at its
root. There is no manifest: Octopus allocates a port, sets a handful of
environment variables, runs the script, waits for the port to accept, and
proxies `/apps/{id}/api/…` to it. It never learns what Python or Node is —
`install.sh` does that, and the agent that wrote the app wrote it.

What lives here is the lifecycle: install, lazy start, readiness, idle stop,
restart on rebuild, crash reporting, and the logs that make a dead backend
debuggable. Routing lives in `routers/applications.py`; the directory layout
and the reasoning behind it are in the plan doc §3.

    Octopus deliberately does not hand a backend the server's environment — it

    "minimal" has to still mean *usable*: a POSIX-shaped `PATH`/`HOME`/`LANG`
    leaves Windows tools unable to find their own system root, their temp dirs,
    or the machine's proxy, and none of that fails loudly. Both of the following
    were a real app's backend, measured, not hypothetical:

    * Without `SystemRoot`, git's curl could not reach even a *loopback* proxy —
      `Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7891` — one variable apart from a
      working run.
    * With `HOME` set to a POSIX `/tmp` (the server's own value on Windows),
      git never read `~/.gitconfig`: no proxy, no CA settings, no credential
      helper. A `git fetch` then hung on a direct connection to the git host
      instead of failing, which in the UI looks like a clone that never ends.

    Nothing here is secret: a home directory, a temp directory, and the proxy
    the machine already uses. The token is still not in this dict, which is what
    the exclusion test pins.
