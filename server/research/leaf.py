"""Research leaf executors (native-deep-research.md §4–5).

A "leaf" is one fan-out unit:
  - WEB leaf (`run_web_leaf`): an isolated, scoped `HarnessRun` sub-turn that
    uses the backend's native web tools (read-only) to search/read and return
    text. It carries NO inherited MCP/connectors/memory, a scratch cwd, a
    minimal system prompt, and `web_research=True` (the profile renders a
    web-enabled, destructive-tool-free turn) — so it can't touch the user's
    session or the host.
  - REASONING leaf (`run_reason_leaf`): a tool-free `run_oneshot` (scope
    decompose, synthesize) — the same agnostic primitive schedule_ai uses.

Both return a `LeafResult` and never raise: a failed leaf degrades to
`error` text so the orchestrator can carry on. Backend-agnostic.
