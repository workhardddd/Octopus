"""Resolve a `/showme <reference>` user input to a concrete file path.

Three layers, cheapest first:

  1. **Exact-path short-circuit.** If `<reference>` is already a real file in
     the session's working directory, return it directly — no model call.
  2. **One-shot model call.** Ask the session's harness (via `run_oneshot`)
     to interpret the reference using recent conversation context. Tolerates
     fences and surrounding prose when extracting the JSON object (the same
     pattern `schedule_ai.extract_json` uses).
  3. **Bare-path fallback.** If the model returns a single path-shaped token
     rather than JSON, accept it. Lots of one-shot replies look like
     `README.md` rather than `{"path":"README.md"}` and that's a legit
     resolution.

Layer 3 is what saved us from breaking on `/showme the readme` — the model
often replies with just the path even when told to use JSON.
