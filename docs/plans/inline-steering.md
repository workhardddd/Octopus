# Inline steering — and the turn latency that pays for it

> **Fixed 2026-09-19:** the writer task's variable was declared *inside* the
> turn's `try`, but closed in its `finally` — so a turn that never got that far
> (a `backend.start()` failure, a cancel) died in cleanup with
> `UnboundLocalError` instead of surfacing its own error, and the real cause
> never reached the logs. Declared before the `try` now, with a regression test.

> **Implementation status: ALL THREE STAGES SHIPPED.** Three staged
> changes (§4). Every CLI behaviour and every number below is *measured*
> against our own `claude 2.1.272`, not assumed.

## 1. The idea

Today, a message sent to a running session goes into `_pending_queue`
(`server/session_manager.py:1629`) and sits there until the turn ends. Your only
way to change a turn already in flight is Esc, which throws the turn away.

**Steering** is the third option: the message reaches the agent *during* the
turn, and it adapts. "Not that file." "Skip the tests, just show me the diff."
The turn keeps its context and keeps going.

This needs no TUI and no pty. `claude --print` has a real-time input channel —
`--input-format stream-json` — which we have never used. Adopting it also
happens to be the largest speed win available to us (§3), which is why this doc
covers both.

## 2. What the CLI actually does (verified)

**A turn with no tools cannot be steered.** Steer written at 3.0s; the model
generated for 71.6s, finished the whole task, and only then consumed the steer
as a second turn.

**A turn with tools can.** Five sequential `Bash` calls:

```
[ 2.3s] TOOL Bash: sleep 4; echo STEP1
[ 6.0s] >>> STEER SENT <<<
[ 6.4s] tool_result: STEP1
[ 6.4s] <<replayed user>>: CHANGE OF PLAN. Stop after the current command...
[ 6.9s] text: HALTED
[ 6.9s] RESULT turns=2
```

Steps 2–5 never ran. **Delivery happens at the next tool-result boundary**, not
mid-generation: *a working agent is steerable; a monologuing agent is not.* Our
turns call tools constantly, so in practice it lands within seconds.

**The CLI echoes our own uuid back.** A frame stamped with a uuid we choose
returns verbatim under `--replay-user-messages` — exact dedup, not text
matching.

**`RESULT turns=2`** — a steered turn counts as two turns in one run. Our
cost/turn accounting assumes one.

## 3. What our turns actually cost (measured)

Two plausible culprits for "Octopus feels slower than native", both **wrong**:

| | measured |
|---|---|
| bare `claude --print`, trivial turn | 2.04s |
| + our 4 MCP servers (bg, ask, ask_agent, research) | **1.97s** — free |
| `--resume` a 225K / 32-line transcript | 1.82s |
| `--resume` a **16M / 4909-line** transcript | **0.86s** — free |

MCP startup costs nothing. `--resume` costs nothing, even on a huge transcript.
The only per-turn overhead we control is **process spawn**:

| | measured |
|---|---|
| turn 1, cold spawn | 2.39s |
| turn 2, same process, after a 75s idle gap | **0.90s** |
| turn 3, same process | **0.81s** |
| RSS held per live process | **261 MB** (254 MB after idle; stable) |

A persistent process is ~1.5s faster per turn *and* keeps the prompt cache warm
(`cache_read` 12.7k → 17.1k, so cheaper as well). It survived a 75s idle gap
with no keepalive.

And the reason it *feels* slow, which is neither of the above:

| time to first visible text | measured |
|---|---|
| today (complete blocks only) | **3.95s** |
| `--include-partial-messages` | **1.68s** |

We *discarded* `stream_event` outright, so the UI painted an assistant message
only when the whole block was done, while native streams tokens. Same total time
(3.96s vs 4.22s); less than half the wait before anything moves. S1 fixed this —
`ClaudeEventParser._stream_delta` now turns those frames into `text_delta`
events.

## 4. Three stages

Ordered by value-per-risk, each shippable alone:

**S1 — stream the output. SHIPPED.** `--include-partial-messages`, a
`text_delta` harness event, an `assistant_delta` WS frame, and a footer that
renders the partial answer through `MessageBubble` and drops it when the final
block lands.

Measured in the browser against the live server, not just in the CLI: on a
700-word answer the first text reached the screen at 10.4s and the completed
block at 18.8s — **8.6 seconds earlier than before**, and the win grows with
answer length (a 120-word reply led by only 0.6s). Deltas are coalesced into at
most one frame per 50ms: 128 frames for a ~900-token answer instead of ~900,
with no visible stepping. The completed answer renders exactly once.

**S2 — persist the process.** Two steps, the first of which is **done**:

* *Prompt over stdin* (shipped): `StdinMode` replaces the
  `close_stdin_after_start` boolean, Claude renders `--input-format
  stream-json` with no argv prompt, and `HarnessRun.send_user_frame` writes the
  opening frame. No behaviour change yet — one process still serves one turn —
  but the channel now exists and every turn already goes through it.
* *Reuse the process across turns* (next): the run outlives the turn, a config
  change forces a respawn, and an idle reaper bounds memory (§7). −1.5s per
  turn after the first.

**S3 — steer. SHIPPED.** The accept path (§8), the writer task (§9) and the
composer marker (§12). Nearly free once S2 exists, because S2 is what makes the
channel writable mid-turn.

Proven against the real CLI through the session manager: a turn running four
sequential `sleep 4` commands was steered at 6.0s and replied `HALTED` at 9.8s,
never reaching the later steps. The e2e drives the same thing from a browser.

## 5. Prior art: vm0's "active input"

vm0 (now Okou) ships S2+S3. `crates/guest-agent/src/cli/command.rs:62` spawns
`claude --print --verbose --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json
--dangerously-skip-permissions [--replay-user-messages] [--resume <id>]`. No
TUI. Their frame (`cli/mod.rs:134`):

```json
{"type":"user","uuid":"<ours>","parent_tool_use_id":null,
 "message":{"role":"user","content":"<plain string>"}}
```

Copied below: the self-stamped uuid, the four-way classification of echoed user
events, the bounded+idempotent accept path, an explicit lifecycle.

Not copied: `docs/active-input-delivery.md` is a distributed-systems design —
delivery reservations, receipt journals, webhook-proven quiescence — because
their guest runs in a remote Firecracker sandbox across a network that drops
messages. Ours is a subprocess in the same process as the session manager. The
*requirement* (never lose a steer, never apply it twice) survives; the machinery
collapses to a queue and a lifecycle flag.

## 6. The stdin channel

`HarnessRun` (`server/harness/run.py:259`) spawns with `stdin=PIPE` and closes it
immediately for both backends. `RuntimeProfile.close_stdin_after_start` becomes
`stdin_mode`:

| mode | meaning | backend |
|------|---------|---------|
| `CLOSE_AFTER_SPAWN` | prompt in argv; EOF immediately | codex |
| `STREAM_JSON` | prompt *and* follow-ups as JSON lines on stdin | claude-code |

An enum, not a second boolean: the two states are mutually exclusive and two
booleans can express a combination that must never exist.

`HarnessRun` gains `async def send_user_frame(text) -> str` (write + flush;
a write error is terminal for the turn). The initial prompt goes through the
same method with a **deterministic** uuid (`sha256(session_id:turn_seq)`) so its
echo is identifiable; `build_turn_argv` stops appending `-- <prompt>` under
`STREAM_JSON`. One path, not two.

## 7. Process lifecycle and the idle reaper

S2's cost is memory: **~255 MB per held process**. Seven live sessions is ~1.8 GB
of 15 GB — affordable, but an idle session costs zero today and must not start
costing 255 MB forever.

* The process is held by the session after its turn ends.
* An **idle reaper** closes stdin after `STEER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (default 10
  minutes) without a turn; the CLI flushes and exits.
* The next turn respawns and `--resume`s — today's path, kept as the fallback,
  so a reaped, crashed or server-restarted process is a slow turn, never a
  broken one.
* A hard cap on concurrently held processes, reaping least-recently-used first,
  so N sessions can't pin N × 255 MB.

## 8. Accepting a steer

`SessionManager.start_message` (`:1600`) has two branches: busy → queue, idle →
run. A third is taken first on the busy path:

```
busy and the turn can take input  → steer  (append to _steer_queue)
busy otherwise                    → queue  (today's path)
idle                              → run    (today's path)
```

"Can take input" means the session's live backend is a `STREAM_JSON` process
with a turn actually in flight. Everything else queues, which is the safe
default — the message still runs, just as the next turn.

* **8 pending steers** per turn (vm0's number; it's a person typing). Beyond
  that the message queues instead, rather than being refused.
* **Never silently dropped.** A steer that can't be delivered becomes a queued
  prompt; §9 explains why that fallback is automatic rather than a decision the
  handler has to get right.
* A steer is persisted as a user message when it is *written*, so the
  transcript order matches what the engine actually saw.

## 9. Delivering a steer: one writer, no echo filter

Two things turned out simpler than vm0's design, because our subprocess is
local and theirs is across a network.

**No echo classifier.** `--replay-user-messages` exists to prove the CLI
accepted the input, and vm0 needs that proof — plus a four-way classification
of the echoes — because a network sits between their runner and their guest.
We don't need any of it: `_user_blocks` only turns `tool_result` blocks into
events and ignores text in user messages entirely, so a replayed prompt
produces **no events at all** (verified). There is nothing to double-render and
nothing to filter. A successful `write` + `drain` on a pipe we own is the
receipt, and the CLI's own `command_lifecycle` events carry our `command_uuid`
if we ever want an explicit one.

**One writer, and it must not wait for events.** A steer is *not* written to
stdin by the API handler. `start_message` appends it to
`session._steer_queue`; a small per-turn **writer task** — the turn's only
writer — wakes on that queue and writes the frame.

The obvious cheaper design (drain the queue between events in the run loop)
is wrong: during a long tool call no events arrive at all, so the frame would
sit unwritten for exactly as long as the tool runs — and a slow tool is
precisely when a person reaches for the keyboard. The writer task wakes on the
queue itself, so it writes immediately.

A steer that arrives after the writer task is cancelled is never written, and
the turn's `finally` moves it to the normal `_pending_queue` so it runs as the
next turn. The message is never lost; it just may arrive as the next turn
rather than this one.

**The residual window, stated honestly.** Nothing can atomically know the
CLI's internal state, so there is a sliver between the CLI emitting `result`
and us cancelling the writer in which a frame we write is taken as a *new*
turn. Its events would otherwise land in a queue nobody reads. So the run loop
records whether any steer was written after `result` was seen, and if one was,
it iterates the stream once more to consume that turn's reply instead of
discarding it. The frame is already delivered at that point; recovering its
answer is just reading.

Latency is bounded by the next event, and during a turn events arrive
constantly (token deltas alone are ~20/second), so a steer reaches stdin within
tens of milliseconds — after which the CLI delivers it at the next tool
boundary (§2).

## 10. The regression risk

`server/harness/claude_code.py:666-672` documents why stdin is closed today:

> leaving the pipe open made the CLI wait ~3s ("no stdin data received in 3s")
> on every turn AND — critically — made `--resume` of a freshly-synthesized fork
> transcript fail ~all the time with "No conversation found" (a discovery race
> the open-stdin wait widened).

**Settled: neither half reproduced.** The 3s wait didn't — turn 1 under
`STREAM_JSON` measured 2.39s against a 2.04s bare spawn, because the prompt
frame is written the instant the process is up, so the CLI never waits on an
idle pipe. And resume works with stdin open: `--resume` + `--input-format
stream-json` completes in 1.8s, the same with stdin left open as with it
closed. The full real-CLI suite — including
`test_claude_resume_survives_memory_override`, which exists precisely to catch
a broken resume — passes.

**What did bite, and it was ours, not the CLI's.** Frame uuids must be unique.
The CLI reports the uuid we send back as `command_uuid` on `command_lifecycle`
events and **deduplicates on it**: a repeated uuid means the command is
silently dropped and the turn hangs until its timeout, with nothing on stderr.
The first implementation derived the uuid from `(session_id, turn_index)` with
`turn_index` always 0 on a fresh run, so every turn of a session sent the same
id and the *second* turn of any resumed session hung.

This also produced a convincing false diagnosis: a probe reusing one hardcoded
uuid across two turns "proved" that `--resume` and stream-json input were
incompatible. They aren't. Frame uuids are now random per frame, remembered on
the run for S3's echo matching, and pinned by
`test_every_frame_uuid_is_distinct`.

## 11. Codex

Not in S3. `codex exec` has no mid-turn input; vm0 moved to `codex app-server
--listen stdio://` and still needed `fix(guest): terminate stuck codex steers
after timeout`. Our codex 0.132.0 marks `app-server` experimental. Codex keeps
`CLOSE_AFTER_SPAWN` and today's queue behaviour, and the composer says so.

S1 is separate: if the Codex event stream carries text deltas, it gets streaming
output too; if not, it renders as it does today.

## 12. Frontend

**S1** — assistant text arrives as deltas appended to the in-flight message, and
the final `assistant` block replaces the buffer (never appends to it, or a
dropped frame duplicates text).

**S3** — the composer already accepts input during a turn; today it queues. On a
steering-capable backend Enter sends a steer, rendered with a marker that
distinguishes it from a queued prompt ("sent to the running turn" vs "runs
next"). On other backends nothing changes.

## 13. Testing

* **S1** — parser unit tests over recorded `stream_event` fixtures (deltas
  accumulate; the final block replaces, not appends; a turn with no deltas still
  renders); a store test for buffer-then-replace; an e2e asserting text appears
  before the turn ends.
* **S2** — argv snapshots per `stdin_mode`; reaper tests (idle close, respawn on
  next turn, LRU cap); the §10 fork specs as the regression gate; a real-CLI test
  that a second turn reuses the process.
* **S3** — the classifier over fixtures (all four buckets, uuid-missing
  fallback, `tool_result` never misread as an echo); the accept path (window
  open/closed, queue cap, idempotency, reused-uuid rejection); a real-CLI test in
  the probe-2 shape (steer a multi-tool turn, assert the later tools never ran
  and `turns == 2`); an e2e steering a live session.

## 14. What building it taught (keep these)

Three bugs here were mine, each invisible in a short session and each a slow
leak or a silent slowdown in a long one. They're recorded because the next
person to touch this code can reintroduce any of them.

* **Every frame uuid must be unique.** The CLI reports ours back as
  `command_uuid` and deduplicates on it. A uuid derived from (session, turn
  index) repeated on every turn, so the second turn of a resumed session hung
  with nothing on stderr — and produced a convincing false diagnosis that
  `--resume` and stream-json input were incompatible.

* **Declining to reuse must release the old process.** `backend = reused or
  self._make_run(...)` overwrote `session._backend` while a live ~255MB process
  was still attached, so nothing pointed at it and neither the reaper nor
  shutdown could reach it. It OOM-killed the backend suite twice before the
  cause was found; adding the mid-turn guard made reuse decline more often,
  which made it fire sooner.

* **A bound enforced only by a periodic task isn't a bound.** The held-process
  cap originally lived in the reaper, which doesn't run in tests and ticks
  every 30s in production. It's enforced synchronously at the moment a process
  is held, and the reaper only handles the idle case.

And one about identity: `spawn_signature` keyed on the connector *object*,
whose default repr carries a memory address, so every turn looked like a config
change and reuse would silently never have happened for an agent with a
connector — leaving only the extra shutdown cost. Signatures must be built from
content, never from object identity.

## 15. What this defers

* **Steering a tool-free turn.** No boundary to land on (§2), so it waits for the
  turn to end. Redirecting a monologue needs interrupt-and-resume — a different
  feature.
* **Codex steering.** §11 — needs `app-server`, experimental on both sides.
* **Attachments in a steer.** Frames carry text; files mid-turn raise path
  resolution and ordering questions that text does not.
* **Steering delegation children.** A child is driven by `DelegationManager`, not
  a human at a composer; "the parent steers the child" is an agent-protocol
  question, not a UI one.
