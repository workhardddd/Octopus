"""The real-CLI gates decide whether the `*_real.py` suites run at all, so a
gate that answers wrongly is worse than a failing test: it turns 18 real tests
into skips and the suite still reads green.

CLAUDE.md's rule is that a skip means a lapsed login, not a passing suite.
These tests pin the distinction the gate has to draw — absent/logged-out is a
skip, "we couldn't tell" is not.
