"""Real-CLI agent-to-agent delegation tests (agent-collaboration.md §8).

Auto-skipped when the relevant binary (`claude` or `codex`) isn't on
PATH. Each test sets up an in-memory DB, two or more freshly-created
agents (Octo / Vera / Pete), boots SessionManager + DelegationManager
without the FastAPI HTTP layer, then exercises a real delegation
chain end-to-end.

The parent's `start_message` is wrapped so that the
``[agent-reply:…]`` / ``[agent-question:…]`` / ``[agent-error:…]``
turn injection into the parent is *captured* rather than triggering
a fresh LLM turn — we're testing the chain primitive, not the
parent's reply. This keeps each test to one real LLM call per real
agent in the chain.

Every session and agent here states its `backend` outright. The suite's real-CLI
dependency is `claude` (or `codex`), so inheriting the registry's default kind
would silently move these turns onto whatever that default is — and onto a
different credential.

A real FastAPI **is** served for each test, on an ephemeral port that
`settings.port` is pointed at, carrying the two routers the in-turn MCP
shims call back into: `questions` (for `mcp__ask__user`) and `delegations`
(for `mcp__ask_agent__*`). Without it those shims time out — "failed to
reach Octopus" — and any test whose model actually obeys an instruction to
call one of them cannot pass. Those routes resolve the
`session_manager` / `delegation_manager` module globals, so the bootstrap
re-points the *router modules'* names at this test's own instances
(monkeypatch, so it's undone per test) rather than binding the process-wide
singletons — the managers stay per-test-isolated while the HTTP path and the
test's direct calls still act on the same objects.
